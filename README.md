# 42_piscine

42 is a coding school I attended in Fremont, CA, in summer 2017.
It employs a self-directed teaching model, with students learning entirely from
the internet and from each other. The Piscine, a 4-week intro to the 42
curriculum, was 12-15 hours per day, 7 days a week. It was entirely in C, and
almost no library functions were allowed; I had to write my own simplified version
of the C standard library.

I picked some of the most fulfilling and challenging problems from the Piscine
curriculum to put on my GitHub.

The sudokusolver is pretty straightforward: it solves a sudoku puzzle input from the command line. This was a group project that I returned to and rewrote/finished.

Evalexp evaluates a mathematical expression (given as a command line arg) in the form of a string. I used the shunting-yard algorithm and postfix notation.

Sastantua is a complicated pyramid made of special characters, the design of which varies based on how many levels are in the pyramid. It was a problem that took more math than coding to solve.

Matchnmatch replicates the standard ability of most computer programs to
search with the asterisk character, which represents any number of letters (including none). It checks whether 2 strings match when the second string can contain any number of asterisks.

The BSQ was the final project, and involved finding the largest square that could be made on a board without any part of the square touching any obstacles on the board. It was a group project that I returned to and finished/rewrote after the piscine ended.
